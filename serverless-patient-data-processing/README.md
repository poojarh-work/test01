# Serverless Patient Data Processing System

--

This project is a serverless application designed to ingest, process, and analyze patient health data using AWS services. It leverages AWS Lambda for serverless computing, Amazon API Gateway for API management, Amazon S3 for data storage, and DynamoDB for storing processed data. The infrastructure is managed using Terraform, following Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.

## Key Features

- **Serverless Architecture**: Event-driven processing with AWS Lambda.
- **API Management**: RESTful APIs with Amazon API Gateway.
- **Data Storage**: Secure storage and triggering via Amazon S3.
- **Data Analysis**: Process and store data in DynamoDB.
- **Security**: Encryption with AWS KMS and monitoring with CloudTrail and GuardDuty.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated deployments using GitHub Actions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and configure AWS CLI.
2. Initialize and apply the Terraform configuration to deploy the infrastructure.
3. Upload patient data to S3 and interact with processed data through the API Gateway.

This project provides a scalable and secure way to handle patient data processing in a cloud-native environment.
